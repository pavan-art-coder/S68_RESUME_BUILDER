### *Milestone 2: Frontend Development (Login Page)*

For this milestone, we successfully created the *Login Page* using React's Create React App (CRA). To improve the user interface and design, we will be updating the layout with *Tailwind CSS* for styling and incorporate *React-Icons* for intuitive icons. Tailwind CSS will help us streamline the design process with its utility-first classes, making the UI responsive and visually appealing.

The Login Page will include fields for the user's email and password, and will handle form validation, state management, and error handling for incorrect login attempts. React Icons will be utilized for visual appeal and ease of use, enhancing the overall experience.
